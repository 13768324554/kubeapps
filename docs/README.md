Kubeapps is a set of tools written by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com) to super-charge your Kubernetes cluster with:
 * Your own applications [dashboard](https://kubeapps.com/), allowing you to deploy Kubernetes-ready applications into your cluster with a single click.
 * [Kubeless](http://kubeless.io/) - a Kubernetes-native Serverless Framework, compatible with [serverless.com](https://serverless.com).
 * [SealedSecrets](https://github.com/bitnami/sealed-secrets) - a SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in the cluster and nobody else (not even the original author).

These tools are easily deployed into your cluster with just one command: ```kubeapps up```
