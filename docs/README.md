Kubeapps is a set of tools written by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com) to super-charge your Kubernetes cluster with:
 * Your own applications [dashboard](https://kubeapps.com/), allowing you to deploy Kubernetes-ready applications into your cluster with a single click.
 * [Kubeless](http://kubeless.io/) - a Kubernetes-native Serverless Framework, compatible with [serverless.com](https://serverless.com).
 * [SealedSecrets](https://github.com/bitnami/sealed-secrets) - Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even to a public repository. 

These tools are easily deployed into your cluster with just one command: ```kubeapps up```
